# OneClass

OneClass is a classroom app built with .NET 6, Microsoft Graph API, and React. It is designed to streamline the classroom experience for both students and teachers.

## About The Competition

Hack Together: Microsoft Graph and .NET is a hackathon for beginners to get started building scenario-based apps using .NET and Microsoft Graph.

We are thrilled to be part of this hackathon and have the opportunity to collaborate with other talented people to create innovative solutions using Microsoft technologies.

We are excited to learn new skills, gain new experiences, and contribute to the success of the event.

## Features

- **Classroom Management**: Create, edit, delete, and join classes.
- **Assignment Management**: Teachers can create and manage assignments, and students can submit them.
- **Todo Integration**: Students can add assignments to their todo list.
- **Authentication**: Users can sign in with their Microsoft account.
- **Mail Notifications**: Teachers can send email notifications to students whenever a new resource or assignment is created.

## Technologies

- **.NET 6**: The backend is built with .NET 6 and ASP.NET Core 6.
- **Microsoft Graph API**: The app uses the Microsoft Graph API to authenticate users and access their data.
- **React**: The frontend is built with React JS and wsal for the authentication.

## Installation

To install OneClass, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` and `dotnet restore`.
- Configure the Microsoft Graph API credentials by setting the clientId, clientSecret, and tenantId environment variables.
- Start the development server by running `npm start` and `dotnet run`.

## Usage

- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
- Log in with your Microsoft account credentials.
- Create or enroll in a course.
- Create or submit an assignment.
- View grades and upcoming assignments in the gradebook and calendar, respectively.

## Future Development Plans

Note that while the main features of the app are functional, there are still some areas that require additional development and refinement. Specifically, we are working on improving the project structure, backend architecture and front-end integration to make the app more robust, efficient, and user-friendly.

We also plan to implement additional features in the future to enhance the overall user experience. These include:

- **Classroom Chat**: Add a chat feature to allow students and teachers to communicate with each other.
- **Classroom Video Conferencing**: Add a video conferencing feature to allow students and teachers to meet virtually.
- **Classroom File Sharing**: Add a file sharing feature to allow students and teachers to share files with each other.
- **Optimize Assignment Submission**: Improve the assignment submission process to allow students to submit assignments in a more efficient manner.
- **Gradebook**: Add a gradebook feature to allow teachers to view and manage student grades.

However, despite these areas for improvement, we believe that the current version of the app is still usable and provides value to users. 

We plan to continue working on these enhancements in future updates to the app. Please feel free to provide feedback or suggestions for improvement as we continue to develop and refine the app.

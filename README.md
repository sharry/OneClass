## Future Development Plans

Note that while the main features of the app are functional, there are still some areas that require additional development and refinement. Specifically, we are working on improving the project structure, backend architecture and front-end integration to make the app more robust, efficient, and user-friendly.

We also plan to implement additional features in the future to enhance the overall user experience. These include:

- **Fix UI Bugs**: Fix UI bugs to improve the overall user experience.
- **Classroom Chat**: Add a chat feature to allow students and teachers to communicate with each other.
- **Classroom Video Conferencing**: Add a video conferencing feature to allow students and teachers to meet virtually.
- **Classroom File Sharing**: Add a file sharing feature to allow students and teachers to share files with each other.
- **Optimize Assignment Submission**: Improve the assignment submission process to allow students to submit assignments in a more efficient manner.
- **Gradebook**: Add a gradebook feature to allow teachers to view and manage student grades.

However, despite these areas for improvement, we believe that the current version of the app is still usable and provides value to users. 

We plan to continue working on these enhancements in future updates to the app. Please feel free to provide feedback or suggestions for improvement as we continue to develop and refine the app.
